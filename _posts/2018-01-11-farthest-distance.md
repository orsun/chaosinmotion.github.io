## 心的距离

> The furthest distance in the world,  
> Is the love between the bird and fish.  
> One is flying in the sky,  
> The other is looking upon into the sea.  
> The furthest distance in the world,  
> Is not that I can't say I love you.  
> It is after missing you deeply into my heart,  
> I only can bury it in my heart.

这些都不是我和你之间的距离  
我们的距离是  
[你的无能为力和我的无能为力发生在同一件事情上]  
  
再也不用想象会和你一起去某一个地方  
再也不用到海边等你出现  
  
从未想象过我会离你这么远  
只适合待在你的远方  
永远都无法靠近了吗
